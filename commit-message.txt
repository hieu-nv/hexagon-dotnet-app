feat: Add comprehensive code analysis infrastructure and upgrade to .NET 10

## Major Changes

### Code Analysis & Quality Infrastructure
- Add comprehensive static analysis configuration with multiple analyzer packages
- Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated code quality checks
- Configure SonarCloud integration for continuous code quality monitoring
- Set up CodeQL for advanced security analysis

### Analyzer Configuration
- **Directory.Build.props**: Centralized analyzer package management
  - Microsoft .NET Analyzers (v10.0.100)
  - SonarAnalyzer for C# (v10.5.0.116594)  
  - Security Code Scan (v5.6.7)
  - Threading Analyzers (v17.12.19)
  - Banned API Analyzers (v3.11.0)

- **.globalconfig**: Modern rule configuration with 158+ rules
  - Security rules set to Error level (CA2100, S2068, S4426, etc.)
  - Performance rules set to Warning level (CA1304-1847)
  - Code quality rules for maintainability

- **.editorconfig**: Enhanced with 130+ additional analysis rules
  - Formatting preferences (Allman brace style)
  - Naming conventions and code style rules
  - Performance and security rule configurations

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions workflow** (.github/workflows/code-analysis.yml):
  - Multi-stage analysis (Static, Security, SonarCloud, Quality Gate)
  - CodeQL security scanning with custom configuration
  - Test coverage collection and reporting
  - Quality gate enforcement with configurable thresholds

- **CodeQL configuration** (.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml):
  - Security-focused query selection
  - Path exclusions for generated code
  - Custom filters for framework-specific patterns

### Framework Upgrade
- Upgrade from .NET 9 to .NET 10 across all projects
- Update all NuGet packages to .NET 10 versions:
  - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore: 9.0.6 → 10.0.0
  - Microsoft.Extensions packages: 9.0.6 → 10.0.0
  - System.Text.Json: 9.0.6 → 10.0.0

### Code Structure Improvements
- **Hexagonal architecture refinements**:
  - Extract TodoEndpointsExtensions to separate file
  - Move extension methods to Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder namespace
  - Add DebuggerDisplay attributes for better debugging

- **API endpoint improvements**:
  - Rename methods with Async suffix for clarity
  - Add comprehensive XML documentation
  - Remove redundant code suppressions

### Documentation & Configuration
- **Enhanced README.md** with code analysis section
- **Copilot instructions** for AI-assisted development
- **Global suppressions** with detailed justifications
- **SonarQube project configuration** for external analysis
- **VS Code launch configuration** for debugging

## Quality Assurance
- Zero breaking changes to public APIs
- All existing functionality preserved
- Comprehensive test coverage maintained
- Enhanced error handling and async patterns

## Benefits
- Proactive security vulnerability detection
- Automated code quality enforcement
- Improved maintainability and readability
- Enhanced developer experience with better tooling
- CI/CD integration for continuous quality monitoring

This comprehensive update establishes a robust foundation for maintaining high code quality standards while keeping the application current with the latest .NET ecosystem.
